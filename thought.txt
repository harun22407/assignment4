1- Thought for HTML page
      Use of bootsrap
        a- First link the css part and javascript of boostrap in html page.
        b- Now from the bootsrap, use the navbar as per our choice and modify it according to our need.
        c- Now make the main part of the calculator. Use the form from boostrap and input type should be number for both input number and drop down for choosing operator sign.
        d- Add the calculate and reset button.
        e- Add the result showing area. It should be disabled.

2- Thought for javascript page
   A- Select all the values and record it in const and creat functions.
      a- First create all const by using querySelector or getElementsById or getElementsByClassName.
      b- Now create the reset function. It should clear all the input field when clicked.
      c- Now create the function that clear the answer when user clicked in the input field.

   B- Calculating part.
      a- When user clicked on calculate button, it runs the function that first check whenther the input is number or not by using if else statement. If the input is not a number then it should return Invalid number in the answer field.(Try to change the color of the "Invalid number" text so that user get focused on that.)
      b- If the input is number, then it should calculate as per the user's choice.
